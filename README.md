AttribXML
=========

An XML language for attribution, copyright and licensing information.

The idea of creating AttribXML was born during the development of sample slides for XSlides.
The sample slides use a lot of graphics, images and pictures from third party.
A systematic approach was needed in order to keep track of the authors, copyrights, licenses and sources.

The goals of AttribXML are:
- Keep track of third party authors, contributions, copyrights, licenses and sources.
- Keep track in a systematic way so that it is simple to:
  - Make sure that authors are properly attributed for their work.
  - Deal with necessary changes in case a license is revoked.
  - Do this in the context of arbitrary XML formats, like XSlides, DocBook and XHTML.
